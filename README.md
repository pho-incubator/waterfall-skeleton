# Waterfall Skeleton

A waterfall skeleton implementation.

Waterfall pattern may come handy in designing Pho plugins. 
Pho's graph structure is very convenient for the waterfall approach. 
This purpose of this skeleton is to give developers an easy way to prototype Pho plugins.

This skeleton was released while designing the Feeds Plugin, hence the namespace naming.
